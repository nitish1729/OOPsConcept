OOP:- OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute

OOP provides a clear structure for the programs

OOP helps to keep the C# code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", 
and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug

OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications
with less code and shorter development time

            Abstraction in C#
Abstraction is an important part of object oriented programming. 
It means that only the required information is visible to the user and 
the rest of the information is hidden.

1.An Abstract Base class cannot be instantiated; 
it means the object of that class cannot be created.
No object can be created of the abstract class i.e.it cannot be instantiated.

2.The abstract class is created using the keyword abstract 
and some of the methods of the abstract class also contain the keyword abstract.

3. The abstract methods in the abstract class are implemented actually only in the derived classes.

4. If all the methods in the abstract class contain the keyword abstract, then that class is known as pure Abstract class.

5.Class having the abstract keyword with some of its methods (not all) is known as an Abstract Base Class.

6.The method of the abstract class that has no implementation is known as "operation". It can be defined as an abstract void method ();

7. An abstract class holds the methods but the actual implementation of those methods is made in derived class.

Note:- We use reference of the object then it will show only nessessary methods and properties(Abstaction)
      And hide which are not necessary (Encapsulation).



                             Abstract Class C#

C# Abstract classes are used to declare common characteristics of subclasses.

# A class which contain the abstarct keyword in its declaration is know as abstarct class.

# It can only be used as a base classes that extend the abstract class.

# If a class is defined as abstract then we can't create an instance of that class. 

# By the creation of the derived class object where an abstract class is inherit from, 

# we can call the method of the abstract class.

# Abstract claases may or may not contain abstract methods, i.e., methods without body
(public void Add(); )

# if a class has at least one abstract, it cannot be instaintiated.


# if  a class is decleared abstract, it cannot be instantained;
# To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another clas, provide implementattions 
   to the abstract methods in it.

# An abstract class can have modifiers for the methods, properties etc.
# An abstract class have constact and fields;
  An abstact calss have constructors and destructors;
